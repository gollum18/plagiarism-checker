# plagiarism-checker
An extremely basic plagiarism checker that compares the similarity of files.


This started as a way for me to check for plagiarism in student submission without having to manually look at each file.
I am planning on expanding it with additional features and better validation methods but as of right now it only
supports comparison using the Jaccard similarity coefficient.
